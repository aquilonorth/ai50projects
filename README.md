# ai50projects
This repository is an archive for all the projects I completed while taking Harvard's AI50 course. The course introduced me to a lot of AI fundamentals from search algorithms and logical reasoning all the way to machine learning and language processing; all of those are represented here.

For _Degrees_ I used a breadth-search algorithm to find the shortest path connecting two actors by their shared movies. 
While creating _Tic-Tac-Toe_ I then used a Minimax algorithm to have the computer find and make the best possible move every time against a human player.

_Knights_ was my introduction to constraint-based structural reasoning, and I developed minimal logic bases to allow the computer to solve classic Knights and Knaves problems.
Then for _Minesweeper_ I built on that by writing logic to have the computer pick safe moves when possible based on the known information about the game's board state.

In _Pagerank_ I was introduced to Google's original page ranking search algorithm and the use of probability and sampling.
I expanded on those concepts in _Heredity_ by using Bayesian probability to model and calulcate the likelihood of certain genetic traits being passed on in a family given information about the family members.

For _Crossword_ I had to use logical constraints and domain reduction in order to automatically generate crossword grids. 
_Shopping_ then introduced me to the skikit-learn package and tensorflow so that I could create a machine learning mdoel to predict if an online customer would make a purchase or not based on various data points.

_Nim_ was a reinforcement learning project wherein the computer plays multiple training games of Nim and improves it strategy using Q-learning.
Then in _Trafic_ I built a CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) using tensorflow to tell apart various trafic signs.

In _Parser_ I learned about context-free grammar and had to implement various grammar rules into a base for the computer, which would then parse sentences and extract phrases.
Finally in _Attention_ I worked with a pre-trained model to try and create a masked word predictor, analyzing the attention diagrams that were created by the model to see what patterns emerged in each layer and from each word.

This repository is not here to provide answers for others; please do not use it as such. It's only meant to be a record of my learning process while I worked on this course.
